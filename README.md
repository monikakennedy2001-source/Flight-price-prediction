# Flight Price Prediction

## Project Description
This project predicts flight ticket prices based on multiple factors such as departure time, source, destination, and airline type. It uses machine learning models and is deployed as a Streamlit application.

## Skills Learned
- Python, Machine Learning (Regression)
- Data Analysis and Feature Engineering
- Streamlit App Development
- MLflow Integration

## Dataset
- Flight_Price.csv
- Features: Airline, Date_of_Journey, Source, Destination, Route, Dep_Time, Arrival_Time, Duration, Total_Stops, Additional_Info

## Approach
1. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Regression Model Training (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
4. Model Tracking using MLflow
5. Streamlit App Development

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the Streamlit app: `streamlit run app/streamlit_prediction.py`

## Project Deliverables
- Preprocessed dataset
- Regression models logged with MLflow
- Interactive Streamlit app
